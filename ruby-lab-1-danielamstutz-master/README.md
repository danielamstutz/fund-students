This is the first ruby lab.

## Simple Conversation in Ruby
We're going to write a script to have a simple conversation in Ruby.  

You will need to write this code in a ruby script file to save and run from the command shell.

The script should:

- Ask for the person's name
- Greet the player by name
- Ask for the person's age (in years)
- Tell the person how old they are in minutes (based on the years entered)
- Ask the person what the temperature is in degrees Fahrenheit
- Tell the person what the temperature is in degrees Celsius
- Thank the person by name for stopping by
